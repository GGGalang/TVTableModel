# The TeleTable
Inspired by a messy table we have at our house, I 3D modeled a better version (in my opinion at least) with more features.

I also added details to help you see what it could look like when it's being used (at least here in my house)!
Great time trying to be more efficient with onshape tools. Learned a lotta new techniques and shortcuts!

While you can view the render in GitHub if you access the STL file, feel free to view this link for a better time (expires in 30 Days as of writing):
